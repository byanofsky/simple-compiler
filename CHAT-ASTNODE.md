B:
I'm designing a compiler for a language with the following grammar:
<program> ::= <statement_list>

<statement_list> ::= <statement> | <statement> <statement_list>

<statement> ::= <variable> '=' <expression> ';' | 'print' '(' <expression> ')' ';'

<expression> ::= <term> | <term> <add_op> <expression>

<term> ::= <integer> | <variable> | '(' <expression> ')'

<add_op> ::= '+' | '-'

<integer> ::= <digit> | <integer> <digit>

<variable> ::= <letter> | <variable> <letter> | <variable> <digit>

<digit> ::= '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'

<letter> ::= 'a' | 'b' | ... | 'z' | 'A' | 'B' | ... | 'Z'

Right now I'm designing a struct called ASTNode. What should the structure properties be?

C:
For this grammar, you could define the ASTNode struct as follows:

c++
Copy code
struct ASTNode {
string type; // Type of the node, e.g., "Program", "StatementList", "Statement", etc.
string value; // Value of the node, e.g., "+", "-", "=", "print", an integer, a variable name, etc.
ASTNode* left_child; // Left child of the node, e.g., an expression, a term, an integer, etc.
ASTNode* right_child; // Right child of the node, e.g., another expression, another term, etc.
};
The type field could be used to indicate the type of the node, such as "Program", "StatementList", "Statement", "Expression", "Term", "AddOp", "Integer", or "Variable". The value field could be used to store the actual value of the node, such as an operator symbol or a variable name. The left_child and right_child fields could be used to store the children of the node, which could be other ASTNode structs or nullptr for leaf nodes.

For example, an AST for the code x = 1 + 2; print(x); could be represented as follows:

sql
Copy code

```
           Program
             |
      StatementList
        /         \
  Statement      Statement
      |              |
  Variable '='  FunctionCall
      |              |
   Integer         Variable
      |              |
     1+2            x
```

In this example, the type field of the top-level ASTNode would be "Program". Its left child would be a StatementList node, which would have two children: a Statement node representing the assignment x = 1 + 2; and another Statement node representing the function call print(x);. The Variable node would have a value of "x" and two children: an Integer node with a value of "1+2", and a FunctionCall node with a value of "print" and a child of Variable with a value of "x".

```

```
