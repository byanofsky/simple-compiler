In VSCode, how can I configure run to build and run a C program

C:
To configure VSCode to build and run a C program, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the C/C++ extension in VSCode. You can do this by going to the Extensions tab on the left sidebar, searching for "C/C++", and clicking the "Install" button.

2. Create a new C program file or open an existing one in VSCode.

3. Create a tasks.json file in the .vscode directory in your project directory. You can do this by clicking the "Terminal" tab on the bottom toolbar, then clicking "New Terminal". In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:

   ```
   code .vscode/tasks.json
   ```

   This will open a new file named "tasks.json" in the .vscode directory.

4. In the tasks.json file, paste the following configuration:

   ```
   {
     "version": "2.0.0",
     "tasks": [
       {
         "label": "build",
         "type": "shell",
         "command": "gcc",
         "args": [
           "-g",
           "${file}",
           "-o",
           "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}"
         ],
         "group": {
           "kind": "build",
           "isDefault": true
         }
       },
       {
         "label": "run",
         "type": "shell",
         "command": "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
         "group": {
           "kind": "test",
           "dependsOrder": "sequence",
           "dependsOn": "build"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   This configuration creates two tasks: "build" and "run". The "build" task uses the gcc compiler to build the C program, and the "run" task runs the executable file that was created by the "build" task.

5. Save the tasks.json file.

6. To build your C program, press "Ctrl+Shift+B" (or "Cmd+Shift+B" on Mac) and select the "build" task.

7. To run your C program, press "F5" or click on the "Run" tab on the left sidebar and select the "run" task.

That's it! Now you can build and run your C programs in VSCode with just a few clicks.
